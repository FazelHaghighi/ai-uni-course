# AI University Course Projects Repository

Welcome to my repository for the AI course projects that I completed during my time at the university. This repository contains three distinct projects that demonstrate the application of different artificial intelligence algorithms across various problem domains. 

## Projects Overview

### 1. Connect Four Game with Minimax Algorithm

The classic Connect Four game is modeled here, utilizing the Minimax algorithm. This adversarial search algorithm considers the possible moves of the opponent, striving to minimize the opponent's potential gains while maximizing its own. The implementation showcases decision making in a game context, essential in understanding AI strategy formulation.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of the Minimax algorithm.
- A game interface to play against the AI.
- Strategic AI capable of predicting player moves.

### 2. Pacman Game with Pathfinding Algorithms

The iconic Pacman game is brought to life using depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and A* (A star) algorithms. Each pathfinding algorithm demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of traversing and searching through the game space.

**Key Features:**
- DFS for exploring unknown territories.
- BFS for the shortest path with the least number of turns.
- A* Algorithm for optimized pathfinding with heuristics.

### 3. Task Scheduler with CSP Algorithm

The Task Scheduler is built around the Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) framework. With an intelligent system that uses backtracking and heuristics to find feasible schedules, this project provides insights into practical applications of AI in automation and optimization.

**Key Features:**
- CSP algorithm with backtracking.
- Heuristic-based optimization to increase efficiency.
- Practical demonstration of AI in scheduling and resource allocation.
